# Claremont Colleges Logo Generator Plugin

This plugin demonstrates how to build a panel plugin that takes a selection on the document, and renders a school logo of your choice into that rectangle. This plugin could be beneficial to actors of the Claremont Colleges who are designing promotional material for the consortium. 

## Use
* Install this plugin in your Adobe XD environment.
* Select or create a rectangle, and choose the "Generate Logo" plugin from the menu panel. 
* In the Panel UI, select which college you want the logo for, and click the "Generate Logo" button.
* You can also modify the dimensions of the selected rectangle/logo on the artboard by inputting numbers into the fields above the "Generate Logo" button.
    * Inputting positive numbers will increase the height and width of the rectangle. 
    * Inputting negative numbers will decrease the height and width of the rectangle. 

## Additional Plugin
* You can also click use "Export Logo" plugin on a selected rectangle. 
    * This will trigger a default folder picker, where the user can choose which folder they would like to save to, and the selection will export as a PDF to a file named "logo.pdf" at the destination folder.
